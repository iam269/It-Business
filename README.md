This folder contains a static presentation site for an IT company built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Generated files:
- `index.html` — main page
- `css/styles.css` — styles
- `js/script.js` — interactivity (mobile menu, form validation, smooth scroll)

How to run locally:
1. Open the `index.html` file in your browser (double-click or `Open File`).
2. For development with automatic refresh, you can use a local server (e.g., Live Server extension in VS Code) or a simple server:

   PowerShell:

   ```powershell
   # from the project directory
   python -m http.server 8000;
   # then open http://localhost:8000
   ```

Quick customization:
- Change the company name/logo in `index.html`.
- Adjust the palette in `css/styles.css` (main color is #0b5fff).
- Connect the form to backend in `js/script.js` (simulation sending section).

If you want, I can add:
- page variants (portfolio, blog), forms that send email/CRM, or integration with Google Analytics/Meta.
